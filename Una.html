<center><h1>Little Sunny Big City</h1> </center>
    <center><h4>Sequel To "Little Kiity Big City" Editon 3 </h4></center>
 
 <center><H4>In the big city of New York, trouble came and the heroes needed to act. Sunny Bunny and their new pigeon friends are back.</H4></center>
 <center><p>They are all very worried when Sunny tells them the news.
</p></center>
 <center><p>"How will we stop him?" asked Bunny.
</p></center>
 <center><p>Last time the hero's needed to act Big Bad was behind the plot, this time FAT TAIL and his army of rats have come to create disaster. That's what the hero's thought at least. FAT TAILS army was on the move and making a huge mess like bullying poor baby kitties and puppies.
</p>"Right let's get to it " bossed Pigeon "I'll fly up in the sky and see if there's anything while you guys...."</center>
 <center><p>"while we...." asked Bunny
</p></center>
 <center><p>"While we find out what Big Bad is doing " added Sunny.
</p></center>
 <center><p>Sunny and Bunny went to find Big Bad because they were suspicious about him so they thought they might check.
</p></center>
 <center><p>They found Big Bad in a rather gloomy part of the city in an old broken cafe, where there he was hissing some plans to his gang, whether it was good or bad the two friends did not know.
</p></center>
 <center><p>When they got back to there secret lair (the shed of Sunny's owner ) Pigeon was waiting for them then
</p></center>
 <center><p>" y.. yes FAT TAIL is 100% coming our way" whispered Pigeon terrified as if Fat Tail could hear them.
</p>"Big Bad seems to be up to something" admitted Bunny
</center> <center><p>"Great now we have double trouble" Sunny sarcastically muttered   </p></center>
<center><p>"let's go team" announced Leader Pigeon
</p>After a ton of standing a couple of scratches the hero’s got the kitties and Puppies safe. Now they need to stop the rest of the mess. They found BIg Bad and tried to tell him not to team up with FAT TAIL, and that his home would be destroyed. "
