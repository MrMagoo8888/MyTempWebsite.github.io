        Once upon a time, there was a boy named Bobby who seemed like an ordinary kid. He had a cherubic face, bright blue eyes that sparkled with innocence, and a smile that could melt hearts. But there was something about Bobby that made the air around him grow cold, a subtle shift in the atmosphere that sent shivers down the spines of those who dared to look too closely.

        It all started when Bobby moved into the old house at the end of Elm Street, a place that had been abandoned for as long as anyone could remember. The neighbors whispered about the house, claiming it was cursed, that anyone who lived there was never quite the same afterward. But Bobby's parents didn’t believe in curses. They were just happy to have found an affordable place to live.
        
        Bobby loved his new home. The creaky floors, the dark corners, the way shadows seemed to dance in the dim light—he found it all so fascinating. He would often wander the halls alone, his small footsteps echoing eerily through the empty rooms.
        
        One day, as Bobby explored the attic, he found an old, dusty mirror covered in cobwebs. Its surface was cracked and tarnished, but something about it drew him in. As he wiped away the dust, his reflection slowly appeared, but it wasn’t quite right. The Bobby in the mirror looked the same, but his eyes... they were darker, emptier, like they could see right through you.
        
        Bobby started spending more and more time in the attic, staring into the mirror, whispering to his reflection. His parents grew concerned, but when they asked him what he was doing, he would just smile that innocent smile and say, “I’m just playing with my friend.” They chalked it up to his imagination, but there was something unsettling in his voice, something that made their skin crawl.
        
        It wasn’t long before strange things began happening in the house on Willow Creek. At night, the walls seemed to whisper, carrying Bobby’s eerie giggles through the halls. Shadows danced unnaturally in the corners of rooms, and the air grew heavy with a sense of impending dread. The family cat, who had once been friendly and playful, now refused to go near Bobby, hissing and scratching at anyone who tried to bring it close.
        
        One stormy night, Bobby’s mother, unable to sleep, decided to check on him. As she approached his room, she heard him talking, his voice low and strange, almost like a chant. She pressed her ear to the door and listened.
        
        “I’m almost ready,” Bobby whispered. “Soon, I’ll have it. Soon, I’ll have their souls.”
        
        Terrified, she burst into the room, but Bobby was just sitting on his bed, staring at her with those dark, empty eyes. The room was freezing cold, the shadows seemed to pulse and writhe around him, and in his hands, he held a small, blackened object that looked like a twisted piece of metal.
        
        “What is that, Bobby?” she asked, her voice trembling.
        
        Bobby looked down at the object in his hands and smiled. “It’s just a part of the game,” he said sweetly. “But don’t worry, Mom. I’ll let you play too... soon.”
        
        That night, his mother dreamed of the mirror in the attic. She saw Bobby standing in front of it, his reflection twisted and monstrous, reaching out from the glass, pulling him closer. She saw the mirror crack and shatter, and from the broken pieces, dark shadows poured out, swirling around Bobby like a cloak.
        
        When she woke up, she knew something terrible was coming. She tried to convince her husband that they needed to leave, that something was wrong with the house, with Bobby, but he wouldn’t listen. He said she was just overreacting, that Bobby was just going through a phase. But she could see it in his eyes—he was scared too.
        
        The next day, Bobby’s father didn’t come home from work. The police searched for him, but there was no trace, no sign of where he had gone. That night, as the wind howled outside, Bobby’s mother heard him again, talking to someone in his room.
        
        “I’m ready now,” Bobby said, his voice cold and hollow. “I have their souls. I have them all.”
        
        She burst into his room, only to find it empty, the window wide open, curtains billowing in the wind. Bobby was gone, and in his place, on the bed, was the twisted piece of metal, now glowing faintly with an eerie light.
        
        In the attic, the mirror was gone, leaving only an empty frame, its surface cracked and blackened. The house on Willow Creek was silent, the shadows still, but the air was thick with the sense of something lurking, something hungry.
